# Music-notes-detection
This python code will detect the musical note present in a given instrument's audio file

Here I have used the fast Fourier transformation method to convert time frames to frequency frames. 
now the musical note frequency is found at the first peak of frequency-amplitude plot.

Note that: This program can only be used for detecting a single note from a given wav file.
